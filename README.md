Aggregating all the info for a tournament into 1 convenient place.

The plan is that 1 person would create a "tournament" on the site, and include things such as the name 
of the twitch/mlg stream, the challonge bracket url, any twitter hashtags they would like etc.  

A user can go to the site, and the current or upcoming tournament would be first in the list of past tournaments.

Instead of having to have a bunch of tabs open watching a stream, and trying to find the challonge bracket,
you can get all of the info right there on the site.  A live twitter feed following the hashtag for the tournament
and other information could be included as well
